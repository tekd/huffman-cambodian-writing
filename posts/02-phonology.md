# II. PHONOLOGY

In order to talk about the relationship between sound and symbol, one must have an accurate description of the sound system of the language. The system of transcription used herein was devised for use in the author’s [Modern Spoken Cambodian](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300013160/spoken-cambodian/) textbook, and represents the segmental phonemes of standard Cambodian, which is taught in the schools and spoken by educated Cambodians. Although some colloquial dialects, notably that of Phnom Penh and the immediately surrounding area, differ considerably from the standard at the phonological level, standard Cambodian is virtually identical with the dialect spoken by the majority of the people in the central provinces, and is understood throughout the country.

If this book is used concurrently with [Modern Spoken Cambodian](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300013160/spoken-cambodian/), neither the sound system of the language nor the transcription used here will present a problem to the student. For the sutdent who has no prior acquaintance with the sound system, an attempt is made below at a phonetic description of the sounds represented by the transcription. Such descriptions, however, are at best approximate, and it is recommended that the student have the examples listed in this section pronounced by a native speaker if at all possible.

## A. CONSONANTS

The consonant phonemes of Cambodian are arranged in an articulatory chart below. The terminology used in the chart is useful in later chapters in dealing with the relationships between the writing system and certain groups of articulatorily related consonants. It is also relevant to the arrangement of consonant symbols in the Cambodian alphabet. Those symbols preceded by a hyphen occur both initially and finally.

## B. INITIAL CONSONANT SEQUENCES

Eighty-five two-place initial consonant sequences <span class="ipa">/CC-/</span>and two three-place sequences <span class="ipa">/CCC-/</span> occur in Cambodian words. Their distribution is shown below.

{% renderFile "./_includes/charts/_chart-3.md" %}

When the stops <span class="ipa">/p t c k/</span> occur as the first member of two-place initial consonant sequences <span class="ipa">/CC-/</span>, they are unaspirated before <span class="ipa">/r s h/</span>, slightly aspirated before voiceless stops and all continuants other than <span class="ipa">/r/</span> (except in the homorganic sequence <span class="ipa">/kŋ/</span>), and released with slight vocalisim before <span class="ipa">/q b d/</span> and in the sequence <span class="ipa">/kŋ/</span>. When the consonants <span class="ipa">/q m l/</span> occur as the first consonant of <span class="ipa">/CC-/</span> sequences, they are released with slight vocalism.

## C. VOWELS

There are thirty-one different vowels and vowel combinations which occur as vocalic nuclei of Cambodian syllables. These nuclei are here analyzed as consisting of only thirteen vowel phonemes: ten short vowels and three short diphthongs. In Chart 3 the arrows represent sequences of vowel phonemes (long diphthongs). Long vowels and long diphthongs, which are equivalent in length, are treated as sequences of two short vowels. The long vowels <span class="ipa">/ɜɜ/</span> and <span class="ipa">/ɔɔ/</span> have no short counterparts. ‘The short diphthongs, which are equivalent in length to short vowels, have no long counterparts, and so must be treated as unit phonemes: They are written with a breve to distinguish them from long diphthongs. The following nuclei occur:

## D. WORD STRUCTURE

### 1. Monosyllables

The structure of monosyllables is shown by the formula <span class="ipa">C<sub>1</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>)(C<sub>3</sub>)V<sub>1</sub>(V<sub>2</sub>)(C<sub>4</sub>)</span>, with the limitation that if <span class="ipa">V<sub>2</sub></span> doesn’t occur, then <span class="ipa">C<sub>4</sub></span> must occur. In other words, short vowels are always followed by a consonant in stressed syllables. Thus monosyllables containing a short vowel or diphthong will have one of the following three shapes; the third is rare.

{% renderFile "./_includes/charts/_chart-8.md" %}

Monosyllables containing a long vowel or diphthong occur in the following five shapes; the fifth is rare.

{% renderFile "./_includes/charts/_chart-9.md" %}

Sequences of three initial consonants occur only rarely, and then <span class="ipa">C<sub>3</sub><span> is always <span class="ipa">/h/</span>.

## 2. Disyllables

__Minor disyllables__[^2] consist of an unstressed presyllable of shape <span class="ipa">CV+, CrV+, CVN+, or CrVN+,</span> followed by a stressed syllable. Minor syllables occur with high frequency in Cambodian, and might almost equal the monosyllable in total inventory if not in frequency. In minor disyllables the vowel of the unstressed presyllable is usually reduced to <span class="ipa">/ə/</span> in normal speech.

{% renderFile "./_includes/charts/_chart-10.md" %}

__Major disyllables__ consist of two stressed syllables in close juncture. Most such words are compounds; some, however, are  morphologically simple (as are the first two examples below).

{% renderFile "./_includes/charts/_chart-11.md" %}

## 3. Polysyllables

Polysyllables are rare in colloquial speech, and can usually be identified as loanwords from Pali, Sanskrit, or French sources. Words of up to six syllables occur in formal speech, and even longer words occur in written texts. Such polysyllables tend to conform in normal speech to the stress pattern typical of disyllables; i.e. alternation of an unstressed with a stressed syllable.

## E. MARGINAL PHONEMES AND PHONEME COMBINATIONS

Certain marginal phonemes and combinations are introduced by French loanwords which are not completely assimilated to the  phonological structure of native Cambodian words.

# Footnotes

[^1]: Other analyses of the vowel system are possible, of course, but whatever the analysis, thirty-one vocalic contrasts must be maintained for an accurate representation of standard Cambodian syllables.

[^2]: My use of the terms “minor” and “major” disyllable differs somewhat from that of Henderson in Eugénie J. A. Henderson, “The Main Features of Cambodian Pronunciation,” Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 14 (1952), pp. 149-74.
