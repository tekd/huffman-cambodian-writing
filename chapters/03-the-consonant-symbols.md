# III. THE CONSONANT SYMBOLS

## A. NAMES AND VALUES OF THE CONSONANT SYMBOLS.

There are thirty-three consonant symbols in the Cambodian writing system. As in the Indic alphabet from which they are derived, they are arranged in five groups based on position of articulation, proceeding from the back to the front of the mouth, and a sixth group usually labeled Miscellaneous. These designations are accurate for modern Cambodian, except that the "Retroflexes" are pronounced as dentals in Cambodian. In the chart below, the consonant symbols of Cambodian are listed in their dictionary order, which should be memorized by the student for efficiency in the use of dictionaries. Each symbol is followed by its _name_ when pronounced in isolation, and its _values_ before a vowel, when first in a consonantal cluster, and when in final position.

## B. NOTES ON THE CONSONANT SYMBOLS.

### 1. The Two Series

Notice that the names of some consonant symbols have the vowel <span class="ipa">/ɑɑ/</span> while others have the vowel <span class="ipa">/ɔɔ/</span>, Consonants which are pronounced with an inherent <span class="ipa">/ɑɑ/</span> vowel are called <span class="khmer">អឃោសៈ</span><span class="ipa">/qakhoosaq/</span> ‘voiceless’ in Cambodian, and consonants which are pronounced with an inherent /ɔɔ/are called <span class="khmer">ឃោសៈ</span><span class="ipa">/khoosaq/</span> ‘voiced’, based on the values which they had in the Indic writing system.[^1]

These terms are not relevant to the phonological values of the two series of consonants in modern Cambodian, since each consonant symbol has the same phonological value as its counterpart in the opposite series. Thus we will refer to them simply as the _1st Series_ and _2nd Series_ respectively. The distinction between the two series is essential to reading Cambodian, since the value of a following vowel symbol is determined by the series to which the initial, or “governing,” consonant symbol belongs. In other words, the Cambodian writing system doubles the function of its vowel symbols by using two sets of consonant symbols with a single set of vowel symbols. It follows that there are two consonant symbols for every consonant sound, and two values for every vowel symbol. Thus Cambodian has a _syllabic_ writing system, in the sense that the pronunciation of syllables is represented by _configurations_ of symbols, as opposed to an _alphabetic_ writing system, where a sequence of symbols has a one-to-one relationship with a sequence of sounds. This idea of configuration is strengthened by the fact that vowel symbols are written before, above, below, after, and around the consonant symbol after which they are pronounced.

### 2. Conversion

Those 1st series symbols which lack a counterpart in the 2nd series, namely <span class="khmer">ប</span> <span class="ipa">/bɑɑ/</span>, <span class="khmer">ស</span> <span class="ipa">/sɑɑ/</span>, <span class="khmer">ហ</span> <span class="ipa">/hɑɑ/</span>, and <span class="khmer">អ</span> <span class="ipa">/qɑɑ/</span> can be “converted” to 2nd series symbols by the addition of the diacritic <span class="khmer">ត្រីស័ព្ទ</span> <span class="ipa">/trəysap/</span> <span class="diacritic">៊</span> to the 1st series symbol, giving <span class="khmer">ប៊</span> <span class="ipa">/bɔɔ/</span>, <span class="khmer">ស៊</span> <span class="ipa">/sɔɔ/</span>, <span class="khmer">ហ៊</span> <span class="ipa">/hɔɔ/</span>,and <span class="khmer">អ៊</span> <span class="ipa">/qɔɔ/</span>, so that a following vowel symbol is pronounced with its 2nd series value.[^2] Those 2nd series symbols which have no counterparts in the 1st series, namely <span class="khmer">ង</span> <span class="ipa">/ŋɔɔ/</span>, <span class="khmer">ញ</span> <span class="ipa">/ñɔɔ/</span>, <span class="khmer">ម</span> <span class="ipa">/mɔɔ/</span>, <span class="khmer">យ</span> <span class="ipa">/yɔɔ/</span>, <span class="khmer">រ</span> <span class="ipa">/rɔɔ/</span>, and <span class="khmer">វ</span>/wɔɔ/</span> can be converted to 1st series symbols by the addition of the diacritic <span class="khmer">មុសិកទន្ទ </span> <span class="ipa">/museqkətŏən/</span> <span class="diacritic">(៉)</span>, giving <span class="khmer">ង៉</span> <span class="ipa">/ŋɑɑ/</span>, <span class="khmer">ញ៉</span> <span class="ipa">/ñɑɑ/</span>, <span class="khmer">ម៉</span> <span class="ipa">/mɑɑ/</span>, <span class="khmer">យ៉</span> <span class="ipa">/yɑɑ/</span>, <span class="khmer">រ៉</span> <span class="ipa">/rɑɑ/</span> and <span class="khmer">វ៉</span> <span class="ipa">/wɑɑ/</span>. When a vowel symbol that is written above the consonant symbol occurs with a converted consonant symbol, the <span class="ipa">/museqkətŏən/</span><span class="diacritic">(៉)</span> and <span class="ipa">/trəysap/</span> <span class="diacritic">៊</span> are replaced by the <span class="khmer">ក្បៀសក្រោម</span> <span class="ipa">/kbiəh kraom/</span> <span class="diacritic">(ុ)</span> under the consonant symbol; e.g. <span class="khmer">សី៊</span> → <span class="khmer">សុី</span><span class="ipa"> /sii/ </span> ‘to eat’, <span class="khmer">មឺ៉ន</span> → <span class="khmer">មុឺន</span> <span class="ipa">/məɨn/</span> '10,000'. However, the <span class="ipa">/trəysap/</span> is usually written above a converted <span class="khmer">ហ</span> or <span class="khmer">អ</span> despite a superscript vowel, although either form may occur; e.g. <span class="khmer">ហី៊ង</span> ∼ <span class="khmer">ហ៊ីង</span> <span class="ipa">/hiiŋ/</span> "a kind of toad"; <span class="khmer">អី៊</span> ∼ <span class="khmer">អុី</span> <span class="ipa">/qii/</span> ‘an interjection’. In the dictionary, words spelled with these converted symbols follow words spelled with their counterparts and _having the same vowel symbol_.
 
The <span class="ipa">/museqkətŏən/</span> is also used to convert the symbol <span class="khmer">ប</span> <span class="ipa">/bɑɑ/</span> to <span class="khmer">ប៉</span> <span class="ipa">/pɑɑ/</span>, which does not otherwise exist in the 1st series. All words spelled with oe follow all words spelled with <span class="khmer">ប</span> in the dictionary order.

### 3. The Symbol <span class="khmer">ប</span> <span class="ipa">/baa/</span>

When <span class="khmer">ប</span> <span class="ipa">/b/</span> is followed by the vowel symbol <span class="diacritic">ា</span>, it has the alternative form <span class="khmer">បា</span> to distinguish it from <span class="khmer">ប</span> + <span class="khmer">ា</span> and from <span class="khmer">ហ</span>; e.g. <span class="khmer">បាយ</span> <span class="ipa">/baay/</span> cooked rice’, <span class="khmer">ឆាយ</span> <span class="ipa">/caay/</span> 'to spend', <span class="khmer">ហ័យ</span> <span class="ipa">/hay/</span> 'horse (lit.)'.

The symbol <span class="khmer">ប</span> <span class="ipa">/b/</span> is pronounced <span class="ipa">/p/</span> in the following circumstances:

a) When it is converted to <span class="ipa">/p/</span> by the <span class="ipa">/museqkətŏən/</span>: <span class="khmer">ប៊</span> or <span class="khmer">ប់</span>

- <span class="khmer">បា៉</span> <span class="ipa">/paa/</span> father

- <span class="khmer">បុី</span> <span class="ipa">/pəy/</span> flute

b) When it occurs with a subscript:

- <span class="khmer">ប្តី</span> <span class="ipa">/pdəy/</span> husband

- <span class="khmer">ប្រើ</span> <span class="ipa">/praə/</span> to use

Such words follow words spelled with <span class="khmer">ប៉</span> in the dictionary.

c) In some words an initial <span class="khmer">ប</span> is pronounced <span class="ipa">/p/</span> even though it is written neither with the <span class="ipa">/museqkətŏən/</span> nor a subscript. Such words are listed inconsistently in the dictionary, sometimes occurring among words spelled with an initial <span class="khmer">ប</span>, and sometimes among words spelled with initial <span class="khmer">ប៉</span>:

- <span class="khmer">បច្ច័យ</span> <span class="ipa">/paccay/</span> money (clergy)

- <span class="khmer">បច្ចុប្ឃន</span> <span class="ipa">/paccobɑn/</span> the present

d) In final position:

- <span class="khmer">ប្រាប់</span> <span class="ipa">/prap/</span> to tell

- <span class="khmer">ឈប់</span> <span class="ipa">/chup/</span> to stop

### 4. The Symbol <span class="khmer">ត</span> <span class="ipa">/tɑɑ/</span>

The symbol <span class="khmer">ត</span> is normally pronounced <span class="ipa">/t/</span>(<span class="khmer">តា</span> <span class="ipa">/taa/</span> ‘old man’, <span class="khmer">ត្រួត</span> <span class="ipa">/truət/</span> ‘to examine’), but when it occurs as the initial symbol of disyllabic words whose first syllable ends in a nasal <span class="ipa">/m, n, ñ, or n/</span>, it is pronounced /d/; e.g. <span class="khmer">តង្វាយ</span> <span class="ipa">/daŋwaay/</span> gift. In the official [Cambodian Dictionary]() <span class="khmer">ត</span> is used as the initial for all disyllables whose underlying form is spelled with a <span class="khmer">ត</span> or <span class="khmer">ថ</span>, e.g.:

- <span class="khmer">ត</span> <span class="ipa">/tɑɑ/</span> to continue

- <span class="khmer">តំណ</span> <span class="ipa">/dɑmnɑɑ/</span> extension

- <span class="khmer">ថ្លៃ</span> <span class="ipa">/tlay/</span> to be valuable  

- <span class="khmer">តម្លៃ</span> <span class="ipa">/dɑmlay/</span> value

Derivatives of bases spelled with <span class="khmer">ដ</span> /d/ are spelled with <span class="khmer">ដ</span>.

- <span class="khmer">ដើរ</span> <span class="ipa">/daə/</span> to walk

- <span class="khmer">ដំណើរ</span> <span class="ipa">/dɑmnaə/</span> process

However, due to the homophony between <span class="khmer">ដ</span> and <span class="khmer">ត</span> in this position, such words may be found spelled either way.

### 5. The Retroflexes

Since there are no retroflex consonants in Cambodian, the Retroflex symbols are available for other uses. The symbols <span class="khmer">ដ</span> and <span class="khmer">ឌ</span> are used to represent <span class="ipa">/d/</span> in the 1st and 2nd series respectively, and the Retroflex nasal <span class="khmer">ណ</span> is used to represent a 1st series <span class="ipa">/n/</span>, The symbols <span class="khmer">ថ</span> <span class="ipa">/thɑɑ/</span>, <span class="khmer">ឌ</span> <span class="ipa">/dɔɔ/</span> and <span class="khmer">ឍ</span> <span class="ipa">/thɔɔ/</span> are rare, occurring only in a few words of Pali or Sanskrit origin.

### [6. The Aspirates](http://localhost:8080/chapters/03-the-consonant-symbols/#6-the-aspirates)

Symbols <span class="khmer">ខ</span>, <span class="khmer">ឃ</span>, <span class="khmer">ឆ</span>, <span class="khmer">ឈ</span>, <span class="khmer">ឋ</span>, <span class="khmer">ឍ</span>, <span class="khmer">ផ</span>, <span class="khmer">ធ</span>, <span class="khmer">ជ</span>,  and <span class="khmer">ភ</span>, which represented aspirated consonants in the script from which they were borrowed, represent sequences of a stop <span class="ipa">+ /h/</span> in Cambodian. When they occur as the first member of a written cluster, however, they represent the unaspirated stops <span class="ipa">/p t c k/</span>.

### [7. Final <span class="khmer">-រ</span>](http://localhost:8080/chapters/03-the-consonant-symbols/#7-final)

Notice that when <span class="khmer">រ</span> <span class="ipa">/r/</span> occurs in final position, it is not pronounced (represented <span class="ipa">Ø</span> in the chart); e.g. <span class="khmer">ការ</span> /kaa/ ‘work’, <span class="khmer">ខ្មែរ</span> <span class="ipa">/kmae/</span>'Cambodian’.

### [8. Special Combinations](http://localhost:8080/chapters/03-the-consonant-symbols/#8-special-combinations)

The symbol <span class="khmer">ហ</span> is combined with the subscript form of <span class="khmer">វ</span> (<span class="khmer-sub">  ្វ </span> see Chapter V) to represent the consonant <span class="ipa">/f/</span>; e.g. <span class="khmer">ហ្វឹក</span> <span class="ipa">/fək/</span> ‘to train’, <span class="khmer">កាហ្វេ</span> <span class="ipa">/kaafei/</span> ‘coffee’. In some words <span class="khmer">ហ្វ</span> is pronounced /wɑɑ/ as if it were the 1st series counterpart of <span class="khmer">វ</span>; eg. <span class="khmer">ហ្វូង</span> <span class="ipa">/wouŋ/</span> ‘flock, crowd’. <span class="khmer">ហ</span> also sometimes combines with the subscript forms of <span class="khmer">ម</span> <span class="ipa">/mɔɔ/</span>, <span class="khmer">ន</span> <span class="ipa">/nɔɔ/</span>, and <span class="khmer">ល</span> <span class="ipa">/lɔɔ/</span> to represent the 1st series counterparts of those symbols; e.g. <span class="khmer">ម្ម</span> /mɑɑ/, <span class="khmer">ល្ន</span> <span class="ipa">/nɑɑ/</span>, and <span class="khmer">ល្ល</span> <span class="ipa">/lɑɑ/</span>.

## [C. THE TWO SERIES CONTRASTED](http://localhost:8080/chapters/03-the-consonant-symbols/#c-the-two-series-contrasted)

In the following chart, each consonant symbol is correlated with its counterpart in the opposite series, and both forms are exemplified. Where possible, the examples are words whose spellings differ only with regard to the initial consonant in order to show the influence of each series on the value of a following vowel symbol. The matter is treated fully however, in [Chapter IV: The Vowel Symbols]().

{% renderFile "./_includes/charts/_chart-15.md" %}


## [D. FINAL CONSONANTS](http://localhost:8080/chapters/03-the-consonant-symbols/#d-final-consonants)

Although only thirteen consonants occur finally in Cambodian syllables (See Chap. II, A), all the consonant symbols in Chart 1 except <span class="khmer">ធ</span>, <span class="khmer">ឈ</span>, <span class="khmer">ជ</span>, <span class="khmer">រ</span>, <span class="khmer">ហ</span>, <span class="khmer">ឡ</span>, and <span class="khmer">អ</span>, are used to represent final consonants in Cambodian. Although the symbol <span class="khmer">រ</span> occurs finally in many words, it is not pronounced, since the final /-r/ does not occur in Standard Cambodian.[^3]. However, it sometimes serves to distinguish orthographically between homonyms, e.g.





|  |  |  |  |    |
|----|-----------------------------|---|-----|---------------|
| កា | /kaa/ to address (a letter) | : | ការ | /kaa/ work    |
| គូ  | /kuu/ pair                  | : | គូរ  | /kuu/ to draw |
| ពី  | /pii/ from                  | : | ពីរ  | /pii/ two     |

The symbols <span class="khmer">ក</span>, <span class="khmer">ខ</span>, <span class="khmer">គ</span>, and <span class="khmer">ឃ</span> represent final <span class="ipa">/-q/</span> after the vowels <span class="ipa">/a, aa, ɑ, ɑɑ, eə, uə, iə, ɨə, uə/</span>, and final <span class="ipa">/-k/</span> elsewhere. A given final consonant may be presented by a variety of symbols. In the chart below the most common, or characteristic, representation is exemplified first.

## Footnotes

[^1]:1. The two series are sometimes also referred to as <span class="khmer">សំឡេងតូច:</span> <span class="ipa">/samleiŋ touc/</span> ‘small voice’ and <span class="khmer">សំឡេងធំ </span><span class="ipa">/samleiŋ thom/</span>  ‘large voice’, or <span class="khmer">សំឡេងស្រាល </span><span class="ipa">/samleiŋ sraal/</span>  'light voice' and <span class="khmer">សំឡេងធ្ងន់ </span><span class="ipa">/samleiŋ tŋuən/</span>  ‘heavy voice’ respectively.

[^2]: 2. The <span class="ipa">/trəysap/</span> should be carefully distinguished from the <span class="khmer">សក់</span> <span class="ipa">/saq/</span> <span class="diacritic"> ៊ </span> which occurs as an integral part of the symbols <span class="khmer">ក</span>, <span class="khmer">គ</span>, <span class="khmer">ច</span>, <span class="khmer">ធ</span>, <span class="khmer">ឆ</span>, and  <span class="khmer">ភ</span>.

[^3]: 3. Words spelled with a final <span class="khmer">រ</span> were presumably pronounced with final <span class="ipa">/-r/</span> when Cambodian was first written, and in certain dialects of northwestern Cambodian and northeastern Thailand such words are still pronounced with final <span class="ipa">/-r/</span>.
