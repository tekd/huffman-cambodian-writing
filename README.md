# Cambodian System of Writing and Beginning Reader

With Drills and Glossary by Franklin E. Huffman (1970)

Current live project: https://www.cambodiansystemofwriting.com/


## Web Development

This is an Eleventy project created from the [eleventy-base-blog repo](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog). To run it locally:

1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2.  Serve

```
npm run serve
```

Or build automatically when a template changes:

```
npm run watch
```

## Contributions

This project is in its very first phases and will be updated chapter by chapter. The most urgent needs will concern reviewing for accuracy against pdfs of the original text (which will be provided). Future needs will involve design and possible interactive elements.
